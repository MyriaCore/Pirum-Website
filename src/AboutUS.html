		<p> Our story is a long tale of hope and perserverance as five software engineers that wanted to make large amounts of money with little to no effort.
		Pirum was started nearly 30 years ago as an idea to take values such as the ingenuity of the New Jersey public transportation system and combine it with the 
		the hard work and effort found in the New Jersey public transportation system. Between all five talented developers there is an astounding 3 years of experience,
		working tiredly to bring the consumers the product they deserve. Our company philosophy has always been work smart, take few risks, and cleanliness is next to godliness.
		We hope to improve our assets so we as a company can continue to deliver the product the consumers didn't ask for and we haven't made yet and that can only be done by your donations.
